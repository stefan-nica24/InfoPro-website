# _InfoPro - website purpouses_
InfoPro is a website that aims to help people understand the base of C++ programming language, its uses, advanced algorithms and data structures used in competitive programming. The platform is meant to be not only a great way to start learning C++, but also a way to train for harder problems and improve your skills. Olympiads, contests or even casual coding are great ways to get better at this, so we encourage practicing as much as possible.

From just another web project, we aim to make this website grow even more. It is still in early development, only a few pages about data structures have been added, but more are yet to come. (even interactive problems later)

# _Notices_
1. Still in early stages of development - not all website features work, such as login/sign up pages (concept of platform users will be added in the future);
2. Currently, the only language supported is Romanian, others require translation services from browser;
3. **More changes will be made as we progress in further development**.


### Feel free to test our first release and please reach out if any other feature that wasn't mentioned before isn't working!
